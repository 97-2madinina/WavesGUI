Ever wanted to quickly access your Blockchain funds but had to download the Blockchain for hours before doing so? 
The Waves Lite Client connects to public Waves nodes in order to retreive up-to-date Blockchain Information.
We have all the crypto to create addresses, to sign and verify transactions for the Waves Blockchain. When using the Lite Client you read all the data from the public nodes, you write the transaction directly in the browser and just broadcast a finished transaction.

# Testing

# Security

During registration, the most important information is the wallet seed.

Save it somewhere save, you can also write it down on a piece of paper.

With the seed you can always import your account again.

This seed will get AES encrypted with a password you insert and you can unlock it to access your account on login.
Every transaction will get signed locally with JavaScript and transmitted to the node without revealing your wallet seed or private keys.
